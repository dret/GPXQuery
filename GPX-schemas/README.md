# GPX Schemas

This is not an authoritative place to get GPX schemas; they are simply collected here for convenience.

One possible location to look for GPX schemas is {Garmin's GPX Schema Registry}[http://www8.garmin.com/xmlschemas/index.jsp#/web/docs/xmlschemas/GpxExtensions], but it seems that this location is not very stable. If you try this link an it is broken, please submit an issue (ideally with the updated URI).
